"""
Now, we need to implement a way to interact with our Influx database.
We also want to handle some exceptions so that our API doesn't return
error 500 codes on unhandled exceptions. We have three expections that we
expect to handle. The first being the `InfluxNotAvailableException` which
is what will be raised when InfluxDB can't be reached. Next, we have the
`BucketNotFoundException` which is what will be raised if a user requests
a bucket doesn't exist. The last being the `BadQueryException` which
will get raised if there's an error in our queries.

With our exceptions out of the way, we can build our InfluxDB interface.
The `InfluxWaveClient` will be initialized with a bucket, a token, an
organization, and a url. The bucket will be used when reading/inserting
data into InfluxDB. The URL, token, and organization will be used to connect
to the right InfluxDB instance. The client provides a few "public" methods
to users: `record_wave_height`, `read_wave_height`, and `list_wave_heights`.
It also has two "private" methods: `_insert` and `_query`.

First, we will discuss our "public" methods. `record_wave_height` takes a
few parameters from the caller: a location to record and the wave's height
to record. It create a Point object and then calls the "private" `_insert`
method with that point. Next, we have the `read_wave_height` method. This
method also takes two parameters: a location to filter for and a minimmum 
height to filter on. For example, if we pass "hawaii" and "1.25", we would
be looking for waves in Hawaii that are at least 1.25 (unit doesn't matter).
This would call the "private" `_query` method with the relevant filters
and return the matching data points to the caller. The `list_wave_heights`
method does almost the same thing. It just calls the `read_wave_height` 
method with the default/empty parameters which would match all data points
in the database.

The "private" methods are `_insert` and `_query`. `_insert` will take a 
data point from the caller. It will use InfluxDB's `write_api` to store
the data point in the database. The `_query` method uses InfluxDB's
`query_api` to send the given query to the database. It then puts all
of the records returned from the `query_api` into the pydantic model 
we discussed above in step 1.
